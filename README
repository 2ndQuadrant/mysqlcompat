MySQL Compatibility Functions
=============================

Author: Chris Kings-Lynne

Introduction
------------

This project is a collection of functions, aggregates
and operators that make PostgreSQL mimic MySQL as
closely as possible.

To use the project, you can either find and execute the
few functions that you need, or run all the .sql files
to install the complete compatibility environment.

Installation
------------

First, you must have created a database in PostgreSQL.

Then, a few of the functions are written in the PL/PgSQL
language handler.  If you use these functions you need
to install that handler, like this:

  createlang plpgsql <dbname>

Next, load any (or all) of the .sql files into that 
database, eg:

  psql -f datetime.sql <dbname>

You will see a series of CREATE (and other) tags
that indicates each successful command.  Read any
other messages that appear as they may be errors.

Alternatively, you can execute the SQL scripts via
a GUI tool such as pgAdmin (www.pgadmin.org) or
phpPgAdmin (phppgadmin.sf.net). 

Usage
-----

If you have followed the installation notes above, then
all the MySQL compatibility functions, operators and
aggregates will be installed in the public schema of your
database.  This means you can use them without any special
qualification.

Here are some examples:

SELECT true && false;
=> f

SELECT format(1234.432, 4);
=> 1,234.4320

General Compatibility Notes
---------------------------

In some cases (obviously) MySQL is just too different
from PostgreSQL to allow re-implementation of features.

This usually happens when a MySQL feature would require
changing the PostgreSQL SQL grammar.

Here is a list of major incompatibilities:

* Boolean vs. Integer

MySQL has no boolean type, and instead it uses the integer
values 0 and 1 as boolean results.  PostgreSQL has a true
boolean type and it can accept 0, 1, true, false, 't' or 'f'
as values.  However, by default all boolean values are SHOWN
as either 't' or 'f'.

Since PostgreSQL already has most of MySQL's logical operators
(eg. OR, AND, etc.) which all return 't' or 'f' to mean true or
false, then there isn't much point returning 0 or 1 for the
two or three logical operators that this library implements.
This is just something you need to deal with during porting.

Tip: PostgreSQL includes a boolean to integer explicit cast, eg:

SELECT true::integer + 1;
=> 2

* Time vs. Interval

MySQL has no interval type, and hence often confuses 'time'
with 'interval'.  For example, '123:13:56' is a valid interval
but is an invalid time.

This library uses the PostgreSQL interval type for many of the
MySQL functions that require or return times.  In general
this won't make any difference.

* Missing operators

XOR, DIV and MOD named operators cannot be implemented.  Use
#, / (with integer casts) and % instead.

* NULL handling in && and ||

MySQL has very unusual NULL handling in its && and || operators.
In this library, && and || follow the PostgreSQL way - which
is that if either operand is NULL, then result is always NULL.

This differs from the MySQL way which is:

SELECT FALSE && NULL;
=> FALSE

SELECT TRUE || NULL;
=> TRUE

* Failure to find overloaded functions

In some cases (due to the way PostgreSQL works) you will need
to add explicit casts to some function calls.
